## Lab Assignment 2: Support vector machine

- Implement the primal and dual quadratic formulation of the support vector machine in AMPL.
- Apply to a dataset obtained with the accompanying generator  (linux, windows and mac executables provided). Validate the SVM with data different from that of the training set.
- Optionally (but highly recommended for a good mark) you can apply it to other datasets.
- Compute the separation hyperplane from the dual model and check that it coincides with that of the primal model.
- The report must include all the previous elements (AMPL code, results obtained, analysis of results, etc).
- This assignment is to be done in groups of two students. 

(Note: If you are using Windows, check that your Windows installation has Microsoft Visual Studio runtime libraries, otherwise you may have problems running gensvmdat.exe. If you experience such a problems, I recommed you to generate the data file with the Linux version (gensvmdat) in a Linux box, and then to copy the resulting file to Windows)

## AMPL Instructions
